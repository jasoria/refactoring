MOTIVATION

Naming things well is the heart of clear programming. Variables 
can do a lot to explain what I'm up to—if I name them well. But 
I frequently get my names wrong—sometimes because I'm not thinking 
carefully enough, sometimes because my understanding of the 
problem improves as I learn more, and sometimes because the 
program's purpose changes as my users' needs change.

Persistent fields that last beyond a single function invocation 
require more careful naming. This is where I'm likely to put most 
of my attention.
