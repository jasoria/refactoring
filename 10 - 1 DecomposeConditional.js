MOTIVATION

As with any large block of code, I can make my intention 
clearer by decomposing it and replacing each chunk of code 
with a function call named after the intention of that chunk. 
With conditions, I particularly like doing this for the 
conditional part and each of the alternatives. This way, 
I highlight the condition and make it clear what I'm branching 
on. I also highlight the reason for the branching.

Suppose Iâ€™m calculating the charge for something that has 
separate rates for winter and summer:

if (!aDate.isBefore(plan.summerStart) && !aDate.isAfter(plan.summerEnd))
  charge = quantity * plan.summerRate;
else
  charge = quantity * plan.regularRate + plan.regularServiceCharge;

*/

charge = summer() ? summerCharge() : regularCharge();

function summer() {
    return !aDate.isBefore(plan.summerStart) && !aDate.isAfter(plan.summerEnd);
}

function summerCharge() {
    return quantity * plan.summerRate;
}

function regularCharge() {
    return quantity * plan.regularRate + plan.regularServiceCharge;
}
