MOTIVATION

Magic literals are common literal values that appear 
in the source code, usually in several places. I call 
it a magic literal because it has a meaning that's not 
obvious from its value, unless the reader remembers the 
value from prior experience. But that knowledge is an 
interpretation in my headâ€”I'd rather have it spelled 
clearly in the code itself. I can do that by defining a 
constant for it and using that constant instead.

function potentialEnergy(mass, height) {
  return mass * 9.81 * height;
}

*/

const STANDARD_GRAVITY = 9.81;
function potentialEnergy(mass, height) {
  return mass * STANDARD_GRAVITY * height;
}
