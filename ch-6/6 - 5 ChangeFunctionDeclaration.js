MOTIVATION

A good function name name allows me to understand what the function 
does when I see it called, without seeing the code that defines its 
implementation. However, coming up with good names is hard, and I 
rarely get my names right the first time. When I find a name that's 
confused me, I'm tempted to leave it—after all, it’s only a name. 
This is the work of the evil demon Obfuscatis; for the sake of my 
program's soul I must never listen to him. If I see a function with 
the wrong name, it is imperative that I change it as soon as 
I understand what a better name could be.

function circum(radius) {
    return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
}

function circumference(radius) {
    return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
}
